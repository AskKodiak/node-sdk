## <a name="question"></a>Have a usage question?

We're sure you have questions and sure we've got answers. GitHub is not the best place for them though.

Issues which simply inquire ask about usage will be closed. Here are some resources to get help:

- Read the [API doc](https://api.askkodiak.com/doc/)
- If the doc doesn't answer your question, login to Ask Kodiak and use the chat feature to reach out to us. We'll be glad to assist.

## <a name="feature"></a>Have a feature request?

We love new stuff. Share your idea with us by logging into Ask Kodiak, and clicking on the chat icon.

## <a name="issue"></a>Think you found a bug?

Let's sqash it. Make sure you search through existing issues though before you submit, even closed ones as your question may have already been answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new ticket and include example code that reproduces the issue so we can dig in.
